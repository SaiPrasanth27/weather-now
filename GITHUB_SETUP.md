# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `weather-now`
5. Description: `Beautiful weather app with temperature-based theming using React and Open-Meteo API`
6. Make it **Public** (so you can use GitHub Pages for free)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-now.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "gh-pages" branch (will be created when you run `npm run deploy`)
6. Click "Save"

## Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
# Update the homepage URL in package.json first
# Change "yourusername" to your actual GitHub username
# Then run:
npm run deploy
```

Your app will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/weather-now`
